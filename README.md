# FirChart

FirChart is an open source charting library for OHLCV data. It is in early development and the API is likely to change.

The chart contains some basic technical analysis and drawing features. The long term vision is that FirChart can be a fully open source replacement for advanced charting platforms such as TradingView.

I am also planning to add a custom scripting language for new indicators and strategies in the future.

The roadmap for FirChart is primarily driven by the needs of the Trading Cage backtesting platform (see https://tradingcage.com), but I am happy to approve Pull Requests for additional opt-in features that are useful for other applications.

To use, download this repo and open `example.html` in a web browser. There is not currently any documentation, so you will have to read through the code to learn how to use it.
